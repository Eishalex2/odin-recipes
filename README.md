# Odin Recipe Project

## Project Objective
In this project, I will create a homepage for a basic recipe website
using HTML.

This project will demonstrate my skills with headings, various types of
lists, and links and images.

### Future Improvements
I would like the overall spruce up the website's visuals. When I first
made this, I had not yet covered alignment in CSS.

* Change recipe element orientation with flexbox
* Make homepage more lively
