    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Harken back to your childhood with a homemade, more
        sophisticated version of the class rice krispie treat. Gooey,
        marshmallow-y, and now packed full of crushed oreos!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>20 oz marshmallows, large or mini</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Pinch of coarse kosher salt</li>
                <li>7 cups rice krispies</li>
                <li>20-24 Oreo cookies, about 8-10 oz, coarsely chopped
                or crushed</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter the bottom and sides of a 9X13-inch pan. Set
                aside.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter on low or
                medium-low heat and let it cook until the solids start
                to turn golden brown and it smells caramelly and
                fragrant, 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the marshmallows and cook on low, stirring
                constantly until mostly melted, a few small lumps here
                and there are ok. Add the vanilla and salt and stir to
                combine.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and add the rice
                krispies and Oreos. Stir until evenly combined; scrape
                up the bottom of the pan really well to make sure to
                incorporate all the marshmallows.</li>
            <li>Scoop the mixture into the prepared pan and press
                the mixture into the pan with lightly greased hands
                (smashing them down too hard will result in firm rice
                krispie treats, so use a gentle hand if you want them
                chewy). Let cool before slicing into squares.</li>
        </ol>
