    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A quick and easy pasta dish that anyone can whip up after work. It also checks the box of containing healthy seafood! The shrimp are cooked in butter and garlic to soak up those savory
            and umami flavors before being tossed with pasta. Any noodle-like pasta would work well here. I personally prefer angel-hair for its particularly light and airy consistency.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>8 oz spaghetti or pasta of choice</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta according to package instructions; drain well and reserve 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium high heat, melt two tablespoons butter. Add shrimp, salt and crushed red pepper, and cook stirring occasionally, until shrimp is opaque pink, about 2-3 minutes.
                Remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining butter and garlic
            and cook until fragrant, about one minute. Add the lemon
            juice, pasta water and parmesan cheese and stir to combine.
            Transfer the spaghetti to the skillet and toss with the
            sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp on top and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately.</li>
