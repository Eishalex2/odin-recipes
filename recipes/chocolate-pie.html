    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't like chocolate pie! This chocolate pie recipe is
        quick and easy to make, and it is sure to please a crowd.</p>

        <p>The recipe calls for a store-bought pie crust, but feel free
        to make your own if you're feeling adventurous! I think graham
        cracker pie crusts work particularly well. You can also make
        your own homemade whipped cream to add some decadence to this
        dessert.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole pie crust, baked and cooled</li>
            <li>1 1/2 c. sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 c. cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>3 c. whole milk</li>
            <li>4 whole egg yolks</li>
            <li>6 1/2 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped finely</li>
            <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>Whipped cream, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium
            saucepan. Stir or whisk together.</li>
            <li>Pour in milk and egg yolks, and whisk together.</li>
            <li>Stir over medium heat until the mixture just barely
            comes to a boil and becomes thick, about 6-8 minutes (maybe
            less, maybe more; just watch it!). The second it starts to
            bubble and thicken (note: it should be thick like pudding!)
            remove it from the heat. Add the chocolate, vanilla, and
            butter, and stir until everything is beautifully
            combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the pudding into the pie crust (if there is extra,
            spoon it into small dishes) and place in the fridge to chill
            for 4 hours uncovered.</li>
            <li>Cut into slices and serve with whipped cream!</li>
        </ol>
